Create a Public and Private Amazon S3 Bucket

Download the two image files found at https://github.com/ACloudGuru-Resources/S3BucketsLabFiles to your local machine.
Create two S3 buckets. One bucket should be a private bucket named acg-testlab-private-<random>. The other should be a public bucket 
named acg-testlab-public-<random>. The public bucket should have public access unblocked.
Upload the file image1.jpg found in the lab files to both S3 buckets, and test whether you can access them



Enable Versioning on the Public Bucket and Validate Access to Different Versions of Files with the Same Name

Enable versioning the public bucket. Rename the image originally named image2.jpg to image1.jpg, and upload it to the public S3 bucket, which will be 
created as a new version of the original file. Using the URLs for the different versions of the image, confirm that you can access both images.
